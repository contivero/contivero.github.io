random test failures: tests that worked or not depending on the time of the day,
or depending on the order the test classes were running, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following are some such stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="test-working-in-the-ide-but-failing-with-maven">Test working in the IDE but failing with maven&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A test was failing as part of the Jenkins pipeline, but working fine locally
from my IDE. Even reproducing the execution order of the tests as a test suite
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t trigger the problem. Running the tests with maven though did cause it
to fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately the assertion&amp;rsquo;s error message wasn&amp;rsquo;t good, but improving it was
enough to pinpoint the issue. After switching the assertion to use AssertJ,
the error was something as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Expecting map:
{&amp;ldquo;$jacocoData&amp;quot;=[true, false, true, false, true, false, true], &amp;ldquo;field1&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;value1&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;field2&amp;quot;=123, &amp;ldquo;field3&amp;quot;=true}
to contain only:
[&amp;ldquo;field1&amp;quot;=&amp;quot;value1&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;field3&amp;quot;=true, &amp;ldquo;field2&amp;quot;=123]
but the following map entries were unexpected:
[&amp;ldquo;$jacocoData&amp;quot;=[true, false, true, false, true, false, true]]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We had recently added Jacoco to our build for code coverage. The problem was
that we were using reflection to get the declared fields of a class, and when
running the tests with Jacoco for code coverage, Jacoco adds a synthetic field
to the class named $jacocoData, which was making the assertion fail. The
solution was simply ignoring synthetic fields, which is in any case good
practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tests-failing-depending-on-execution-speed">Tests failing depending on execution speed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some tests were asserting that the time stored in an entity was strictly before
the time when the assertion ran. When the test was fast enough, the time when
the entity was created and the time when the assertion ran didn&amp;rsquo;t differ,
causing the test to fail. Debugging it would cause it to pass, as running it
with a debugger caused enough of a slowdown that the times always differed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This issue is trivially noticed and fixed with the right assertion messages.
If doing, e.g.:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>assertTrue(LocalDateTime.now().isAfter(entity.getCreationDateTime()));
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>having the assertion fail doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us a meaningful message. Using AssertJ
with the right methods provides a lot more information. Fixing the assertion
to consider equality:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>assertThat(entity.getCreationDateTime())
.as(&amp;quot;creationDateTime&amp;quot;)
.isBeforeOrEqualTo(now);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="tests-failing-due-to-ehcaches-singleton-cachemanager">Tests failing due to EhCache&amp;rsquo;s singleton CacheManager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For a long time we sometimes had a cascade of failing tests saying that a Cache
had been shut down. We noticed that it seemed to be that after some test failed,
something was left in an invalid state and affected subsequent tests. In the
end, what was happening was that the code was using EhCache as a singleton, and
when there was an issue initializing an ApplicationContext, Spring was calling
&lt;code>destroy()&lt;/code> on the &lt;code>CacheManager&lt;/code>. This &lt;code>CacheManager&lt;/code>, being a singleton for
the whole JVM, was reused by any other tests needing it, but had already been
shutdown previously. The final fix was changing the code to use separate
&lt;code>CacheManager&lt;/code> instances per application context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somewhat related, there was a test calling&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>CacheManager cacheManger = CacheManager.create();
cacheManger.removeAllCaches();
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>&lt;code>CacheManager.create()&lt;/code> reuses the singleton &lt;code>CacheManager&lt;/code> if there is one
(otherwise it creates it), so it was effectively removing all caches for
subsequent tests, also causing issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tests-failing-depending-on-the-date-or-time-of-execution">Tests failing depending on the date or time of execution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dates and time are full of complexity and provide a myriad of pitfalls. The
options usually are two:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Either making it so that the test can always use the current time and work anyway, or&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a fixed time by having a &lt;code>java.time.Clock&lt;/code> injected wherever time is
needed, and using a fixed &lt;code>Clock&lt;/code> for the test.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="test-failing-the-29th-of-february">Test failing the 29th of February&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We had a test for a method that given a birthday date, would return when the
birthday should be on the current year. The test was using the current time and
shifting it a year in the past to construct a date, something as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>final Date lastYear = DateUtils.addYears(now, -1);
assertEquals(now, DateTools.getBirthdayDate(lastYear));
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>When running on the 29th of February, the previous year had no 29th of February
(since it&amp;rsquo;s not a leap year); the assertion would then fail because it expected
the birthday date to be today, 29th, but was the 28th.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="test-failing-near-midnight">Test failing near midnight&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Part of the code was using java&amp;rsquo;s legacy &lt;code>Date&lt;/code> class, and to better support
caching, it was rounding the &lt;code>Date&lt;/code> to the next hour. The idea was that calling
a service method with today at 16:03:00, or at 16:03:01, or at 16:59, would all
hit the same cache entry, instead of each one creating new cache entries but
always missing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The test was assigning permissions to a user for some action starting tomorrow,
and at some point asserting that the user did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> have permissions for that
action &lt;em>now&lt;/em> (today). However, the code checking these permissions was using
this rounding logic, so that asking between 23:00 and midnight would return
&lt;code>true&lt;/code> (i.e. that the persons did in fact have permissions today at the time of
running), because when rounding to the next hour, it would end up asking about
permissions on the following day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="test-failing-only-between-0000-and-0200">Test failing only between 00:00 and 02:00&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some tests had been sporadically failing for years without anyone knowing why.
Behind not understanding hides a teaching, so I spent some time to figure it
out. I noticed the failures only happened between 00:00 and 02:00, and could
reproduce this locally by changing the system&amp;rsquo;s clock to a time inside that
range. Having a reproduction, the rest was a matter of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on one test, as the others were variations of the same issue.
The test started with creating an entity and asserting that it could be found.
This failed between 00:00 and 02:00.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem was that the entity had a validity (two &lt;code>Date&lt;/code> properties specifying
from when until when that entity was valid), and the service method being used
to find the entity was taking validity into account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When creating the entity, it would have as &lt;code>validFrom&lt;/code> the date when the test
was running at start of the day, say &lt;code>2021-09-19 00:00:00.0&lt;/code>. For the HQL query,
the problematic part of the where clause was:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> validFrom &amp;lt;= current_timestamp()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>at first sight, this looks fine. What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? The test was using HSQLDB,
and Hibernate translates &lt;code>current_timestamp()&lt;/code> to HSQLDB&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>current_timestamp&lt;/code>,
which includes a time zone. Running the test in Vienna with time zone UTC+2
meant the condition would look something as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 2021-09-19 00:00:00.0 &amp;lt;= 2021-09-19 00:13:39.611+02
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>HSQLDB would then take the time zone into account, and use UTC for the
&lt;code>validFrom&lt;/code> date. Shifting to UTC, the condition would look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 2021-09-19 00:00:00.0 &amp;lt;= 2021-09-18 22:13:39.611
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>which makes the issue more obvious. The condition was thus true between 02:00
and midnight, making the test normally pass, and false between 00:00 and 02:00,
making it fail during that time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution was using &lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code> which returns a value of type DATE, i.e.
does not include time zone, but read the next one about &lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hql-query-parameter-vs-current_date">HQL Query Parameter vs. &lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After some code changes a test started failing. The test was creating an entity
with a validity: two &lt;code>Date&lt;/code> properties called &lt;code>validFrom&lt;/code> and &lt;code>validTo&lt;/code>, where
the first one was &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo;, and the second one &amp;ldquo;infinity&amp;rdquo; (some big sentinel value
for the date). At some point we were querying for this entity, and the result
set was coming empty. Eventually I narrowed down the problem to a change in the
HQL query. I had replaced a &lt;code>Date&lt;/code> parameter by &lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code>, i.e. the
query used to be something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>session.createQuery(
&amp;quot;select ... from ... &amp;quot;
+ &amp;quot;where :date between validFrom and validTo&amp;quot;)
.setParameter(&amp;quot;date&amp;quot;, new Date())
.list();
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>and I replaced the where condition by &lt;code>current_date() between validFrom and validTo&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some time, I found out that the time reported by the dockerized SQL
Server DB (using testcontainers) was an hour in the past. This was because by
default the docker container was using UTC as timezone, but I was running the
test in Vienna, which had UTC+1 at the time. I fixed this, so that the timezone
of the container matched the one used by the JVM (using the &lt;code>TZ&lt;/code> environment
variable).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I was done, but then the test started randomly failing. When
debugging the test though, it always passed (a so-called &amp;ldquo;Heisenbug&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, I noticed that the time reported by SQL Server was some milliseconds
behind the time reported by Java. Hibernate translates &lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code> to SQL
Server&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>GetDate()&lt;/code>, which includes the time apart from the date. Thus, when
the test executed fast enough, sometimes the date-time returned by using
&lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code> was slightly in the past compared to the time as seen in Java,
making the query fail (because the &lt;code>validFrom&lt;/code> of the created entity was some
milliseconds &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the &lt;code>current_date()&lt;/code> time when executing the query). By then
I had spent enough figuring out the issue, that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend more figuring
out why the millisecond mismatch. I simply changed the query to use a parameter,
in that way the time was sure to be right.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modifying-in-memory-state">Modifying in-memory state&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sometimes a test would change a setting in a Spring singleton (say, changing a
flag to enable a feature), and wasn&amp;rsquo;t resetting it to its default. Then another
test class using the same application context would run, and implicitly rely on
the default value being used, failing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A variation of this was a test modifying a &lt;code>ThreadLocal&lt;/code> variable and not
resetting it, making a later test fail because it was implicitly relying on such
variable being null when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-a-static-reference-of-the-applicationcontext">Using a static reference of the ApplicationContext&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We had a static reference to the &lt;code>ApplicationContext&lt;/code>, which was meant to be
used in classes that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be Spring beans, that is classes where we couldn&amp;rsquo;t
rely on Spring wiring the needed dependencies &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> (think for instance a Log4J2
plugin such as a custom appender). Unfortunately, throughout the years this was
misused, used in places where it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been. Then weird things would
happen with tests. A typical example would be 3 tests running as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Test1, using ApplicationContext A.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test2, using ApplicationContext B.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test3, using ApplicationContext A.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When Test1 initialized the application context, it would set the static
reference; then Test2 would do the same. Test3 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, though, because it
didn&amp;rsquo;t initialize the application context, it reused the one that had already
been initialized before (because Spring caches it). Then Test3 would try to use
a bean from a different application context, leading to errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even when later this was changed so that each test would reset the static
reference, it was not enough, as some classes were getting a dependency from
the application context and caching it, or storing it in a &lt;code>static final&lt;/code> field,
which would still lead to a test using a bean from the wrong application
context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this is of course avoided by following standard dependency injection
recommendations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="metadataextractorintegrator">MetadataExtractorIntegrator&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In one of his articles, Vlad Mihalcea shows &lt;a href="https://vladmihalcea.com/how-to-get-access-to-database-table-metadata-with-hibernate-5/">how to get access to database metadata&lt;/a>
in Hibernate 5. The idea is registering a Hibernate &lt;code>Integrator&lt;/code> and reading the
&lt;code>SessionFactory&lt;/code>'s metadata. In that article the class is a singleton, keeping
the sole instance in a &lt;code>static final&lt;/code> field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As described, that works fine in production, but can cause issues during
testing. Different application contexts can have different Hibernate entities
(depending on which entities are registered while building the
&lt;code>SessionFactory&lt;/code>). What I saw happening was again a problem with test running
order and Spring&amp;rsquo;s application context caching. Again, given:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Test1, using ApplicationContext A.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test2, using ApplicationContext B.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test3, using ApplicationContext A.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If ApplicationContext B had a smaller set of entities, then Test3 could fail because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Test1 runs, intializes ApplicationContext A, and the
MetadataExtractorIntegrator extracts the metadata and keeps it in its
&lt;code>INSTANCE&lt;/code> field.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test2 runs, intializes ApplicationContext B, and the
MetadataExtractorIntegrator extracts the metadata and overwrites the one kept
on its &lt;code>INSTANCE&lt;/code> field.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test3 runs, using the cached ApplicationContext A, with the metadata from
ApplicationContext B. At some point the test requests metadata for an entity
for which we have no data, since the &lt;code>SessionFactory&lt;/code> in ApplicationContext B
isn&amp;rsquo;t aware of it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The fix for this was having a singleton Spring bean which stored the metadata
read by the &lt;code>MetadataExtractorIntegrator&lt;/code>, and having the rest of the code use
that bean instead of the &lt;code>MetadataExtractorIntegrator&lt;/code> &lt;code>INSTANCE&lt;/code>. In that way,
each application context had access to the right metadata.&lt;/p>

which took over 4 hours to run. The suite had around 8100 tests, many of which
were integration tests using a Spring &lt;code>ApplicationContext&lt;/code>. I managed to get this
down to around 1h 20~30 mins, until other priorities prevented further
reductions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What follows is how this was achieved, and what things to watch out for.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-a-single-jvm-for-the-tests-in-a-project">Using a single JVM for the tests in a project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The very first point is reusing forks in your maven-surefire-plugin and
maven-failsafe-plugin configurations. This is the default, but many of the
projects had &lt;code>&amp;lt;reuseForks&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/reuseForks&amp;gt;&lt;/code>. Using &lt;code>false&lt;/code> means that for each
test class a new JVM is used. This makes it easier to keep tests isolated, since
no JVM-global state is preserved (e.g. static variables). The downside is that
this is costlier than using a single JVM for all tests, and Spring&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;code>ApplicationContext&lt;/code> caching cannot work. This leads us to the next point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="spring-applicationcontext-caching">Spring ApplicationContext caching&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By default Spring keeps each application context it needs to create cached, and
reuses them whenever possible. For two tests to use the same application context
they not only need to point to the same configuration (using the same
&lt;code>locations&lt;/code> or &lt;code>classes&lt;/code> in &lt;code>@ContextConfiguration&lt;/code>), but a bunch of other
things. For instance, if a test specifies a different &lt;code>initializer&lt;/code>, then that
implies using a different application context (for further details refer to
&lt;code>MergedContextConfiguration&lt;/code>, which is what Spring uses as key for the map of
application contexts it uses as cache).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus, one should try to use the same application context for all tests in a
project that run under the same JVM. Sometimes a different application context
makes sense, but the less the better, performance-wise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watch-out-for-jvm-global-state">Watch out for JVM-global state&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once the tests run under the same JVM, global state matters more. As always, we
need to minimize its usage, and keep it in mind to avoid flaky tests. An obvious
example is System properties. Another example is EhCache, which supports using
it as a singleton (e.g. with Hibernate&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory&lt;/code>, or
calling &lt;code>CacheManager.create()&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any JVM singleton carries issues, as changes to the state by one test can affect
subsequent ones if we don&amp;rsquo;t properly clean up after it. By JVM singleton I mean
a class using a standard implementation of the Singleton pattern, such as using
an enum (as recommended by Bloch in Effective Java), or a static field.
Singleton Spring beans can still be a problem (if they have state), but are a
bit less susceptible because different &lt;code>ApplicationContexts&lt;/code> can have different
instances, so at least tests running with different &lt;code>ApplicationContext&lt;/code> won&amp;rsquo;t
affect each other through that bean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, relying on such state complicates running tests in parallel, as then
if test A passes or not can depend on whether some other test B that also
modifies the same state runs at the same time or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watch-out-for-thread-bound-values">Watch out for thread-bound values&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When relying on a &lt;code>ThredLocal&lt;/code> value, you need to make sure your tests clear it
after being done, and tests that depend on it set the appropriate value at the
beginning, even if this value is the default one (say, null). Both are solutions
to the same issue: if each test cleans up after using the thread-bound resource,
then later tests don&amp;rsquo;t need to set the default again, and if other tests set the
needed value at the start (even if it&amp;rsquo;s the default), then previous tests don&amp;rsquo;t
need to clean up. Having both is mostly for better resilience, and setting the
right value at the beginning (even if it&amp;rsquo;s the default) is being explicit about
a tests prerequisites, so it also works as documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reusing-database-between-tests">Reusing database between tests&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Starting up a database is costly, even when using an in-memory one such as
HSQLDB. Using a docker instance of the same DBMS as in production with
testcontainers is better—and costlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It thus makes sense from a performance perspective to try to use a single
database for all tests in a suite. This of course introduces another point
through which different tests can affect each other. For example, if a test
creates two instances of an entity in a database, and then asserts that there
are actually two such instances in there, it can fail if some other test created
another instance before. This means we cannot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Run assertions about the whole state of a database table (aggregations such
as count, max or min can be problematic).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run statements that modify the whole state of a table, such as deleting all
rows.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As a practical example of (2), when initializing the application context, we had
some logic to create some default entries in the database (if missing) which we
could later expect to always be there (e.g. default currency, default language,
etc.) A test that deleted all data for one of these tables ended up corrupting
subsequent tests that expected such defaults to be in the database, but didn&amp;rsquo;t
find them (because they reused the &lt;code>ApplicationContext&lt;/code>, so the defaults weren&amp;rsquo;t
re-created).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How should different tests use the same database then? One option is expecting
each test to clean up after itself. This can work, but is of course error-prone,
as it&amp;rsquo;s easy for a developer to forget it (or not do it thoroughly enough), and
end up causing hard-to-track flaky tests. The other side of the same coin is
expecting each test to make sure the database is in the right state before
running (i.e. by clearing the needed tables). But this suffers from the same
downsides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another frequently used approach is recreating the whole DB when a test starts,
and dropping the whole DB at the end of it. This can be easier to automatize,
and then avoids the previously mentioned issue. All three approaches though
complicate parallelizing tests, since having two tests that need the same
database table run in parallel can easily lead to race conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A better option is randomizing test data. By creating fresh, unique entries
in the database that are sufficiently random, then&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Tests are less likely to affect each other. Of course the initial
restrictions still apply: running aggregation functions on tables or performing
statements that alter state that other tests need (such as deleting all entries
in a table) are still problematic. Tests need to run assertions specific to the
data they create, but this is seldom a problem.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no need to clean up between tests. Tests can freely pollute the
database, and some argue this is even more realistic, as it&amp;rsquo;s closer to how it
would be in production (it&amp;rsquo;s artificial to always have a clean empty database
for each use-case).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lastly, they are amenable to parallelization, because no clean up is
performed, and because with sufficiently random data no unique constraint
should be violated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To support this, the creation of frequently used entities can be encapsulated in
some helper classes. JUnit 5 extensions can also reduce a lot of the boilerplate
(so that registering an extension will create a bunch of randomized entities and
their needed relations), and there is even some libraries that can simplify this
further (e.g. instancio).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
